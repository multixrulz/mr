For next time around:

Order pracs differently

* Forces simulator
* Parachutes
* Friction race
* Rolling cars
* Magnets
* Static electricity
* Ball thrower / boomerang
* Levers
* Bernoulli (gravity in there)

Static prac:
Rods and wool cloth didn't work very well - spotty results.  Balloons might work better.
